# Guess the Number Game

A simple command-line "Guess the Number" game written in Python.

## How to Play

1. Run the Python script:
   ```
   python guess_the_number.py
   ```
2. The computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100.
3. Enter your guesses when prompted.
4. After each guess, you'll receive feedback:
   - "Too low!" if your guess is less than the number.
   - "Too high!" if your guess is greater than the number.
5. Keep guessing until you find the correct number. The game will tell you how many attempts you made.
